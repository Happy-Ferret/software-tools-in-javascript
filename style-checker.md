# Style Checker

1.  Show how linting tools like [eslint](https://eslint.org/) parse source code,
    walk the parse tree to collect interesting nodes,
    and then check those nodes against rules.
2.  Extend that basic tool to show how to make the ruleset pluggable.

This shows:

-   That code is just another kind of data.
-   How to build tools that work with parsed code.
-   How to make a plugin-based tool.
