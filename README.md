## Content

To suggest a tool that should be covered,
please put a one-paragraph description of the tool and the reason it's interesting
in a file called `tool-name.md`
(e.g., `style-checker.md`)
and add a link to that file to the list in [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md).
Where feasible,
include links in that file to examples of the kind of tool being suggested.
