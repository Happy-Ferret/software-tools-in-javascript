# Unit Testing Framework

1.  Show how a unit testing framework works when test functions are explicitly enumerated.
2.  Show how such a framework can introspect loaded code to find test functions.
3.  Show how it can find files that contain tests and load them dynamically (i.e., not using `require`).
4.  Show how to make a pluggable reporting system.

This shows:

-   That code is another kind of data.
-   Introspection.
-   Plugins.

We could add an assertion library (there are so… many…).
