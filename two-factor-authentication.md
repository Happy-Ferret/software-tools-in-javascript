# Two-Factor Authentication

Implement some kind of challenge/response two-factor authentication,
e.g. using a [time-based one-time password algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm).

This shows:

-   How passwords should be managed.
-   How to handle timeouts on user events.
-   That security has to be baked in.

This could build on the simple text-mode browser.
