# Library Loader

Show how to implement `require` for loading libraries using [this blog post](http://fredkschott.com/post/2014/06/require-and-the-module-system/) as a starting point.

This shows:

-   That code is just another kind of data.
-   How caching works.
-   How changing configuration (load path) can change program behavior.
-   Which in turn can be used to implement virtual environments.
